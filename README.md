# Transfer-learning-with-ResNet-for-Image-Classification
This notebook implements image classification using a ResNet neural network architecture. Beginning with the importation of essential libraries, the process involves loading and preprocessing a dataset for training and validation. The ResNet model is defined, incorporating skip connections for improved feature learning, and is configured with an optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metrics. The model is then trained on the dataset, with performance assessed on a validation set. Evaluation on a separate test dataset demonstrates the model's generalization capabilities, and predictions are made on new data. Training history is visualized to analyze model learning. The trained ResNet model is saved for future use or deployment. The notebook concludes by summarizing key steps and suggesting potential areas for further exploration or optimization in future work.
